= Structural selections for Kakoune

kak-tree is a plugin for Kakoune which enables selection of syntax tree nodes. Parsing is performed with https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter[tree-sitter].

Status: proof of concept.

== Installation

----
git clone --recurse-submodules
cargo build --release
cargo install
cp rc/tree.kak ~/.config/kak/autoload/
----

You might want to remove unused languages from `build.rs` and `src/main.rs` to reduce binary size.

== Usage

|===
| tree-select-node | Extend selections to the deepest enclosing nodes. If any selection is equal to node range, then extend to one's parent range.

More commands to come.
