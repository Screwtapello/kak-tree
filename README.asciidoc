= Structural selections for Kakoune

kak-tree is a plugin for Kakoune which enables selection of syntax tree nodes. Parsing is performed with https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter[tree-sitter].

Status: proof of concept.

== Installation

Replace `"rust javascript"` with a list of languages you need. Or use `all` to build all supported
languages. Note that `all` build takes a long time, and resulting binary is quite fat which could
have a negative impact on responsiveness.

----
git clone --recurse-submodules
cargo build --release --features "rust javascript"
cargo install
cp rc/tree.kak ~/.config/kak/autoload/
----

Look at `Cargo.toml` for a full list of supported languages.

== Usage

|===
| tree-select-node | Extend selections to the deepest enclosing nodes. If any selection is equal to node range, then extend to one's parent range.

More commands to come.
